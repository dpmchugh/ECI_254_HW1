## 1. A Short Introduction

My name is Devin McHugh, and I am a first-year master's student in the Geography Graduate Group and the University of California, Davis. I am a researcher in the Plant and Environmental Informatics Lab on campus, and my graduate thesis will focus on the integration of tower and satellite remote sensing techniques to better understand carbon use efficiency of forest ecosystems. After obtaining my master's degree, I am interested in pursuing applied research for remote sensing of the environment to predict drivers of climate change. I am taking this course to learn R programming, for it is essential for my optimal success in data extraction, visualization, and analyses.

## 2. My favorite music


My favorite musical artist is *Iron & Wine*. You can find more information about their music on this [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_%26_Wine) page.

## 3. Data analyses using ggplot

### 3a. Age versus death probability

```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}

library(dslabs)
library(tidyverse)

```

``` {r}
ggplot(death_prob) + geom_point(aes(age,prob))

```

This figure displays the probability of death in humans given a specific age. Note that this chart shows black, circular dots for both represented groups in the dataset (male and female).
